# FortranNeuralNet
I wrote a "simple" neural net in fortran to teach myself the language. It predicts the value of D where D = A XOR B XOR C, where A, B, and C are integers 0 or 1. 

This program was written on Arch Linux, and is compiled with gcc-fortran. I don't know how well it will work on other systems. As of me writing this (2023-06-15), it already needs improvement on my own system.

To compile this program, simply run gfortran with the -ffree-form flag.
